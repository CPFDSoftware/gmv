 *  PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:
 *
 *	This routine will take the file name specified and
 *	open or create it depending on the access parameter.
 *	An attempt is made to save any existing file of the
 *	same name.
 *
 *
 *  FORMAL PARAMETERS:
 *
 * 	name		the system-dependent file spec of the IDB file
 *			to be opened.
 *	accss		access type desired, read or write access.
 *	os_ext		an operating specific structure to take advantage
 *			of file system features (if any).
 *	file_id		IDB file id used in all calls to low level routines.
 *	returned_fname	The resultant file name.
 *
 *  IMPLICIT INPUTS:
 *
 *      NONE
 *
 *  IMPLICIT OUTPUTS:
 *
 *      NONE
 *
 *  FUNCTION VALUE:
 *
 *	Returns an integer:
 *
 *	MrmSUCCESS	- When access is read and open works
 *	MrmCREATE_NEW	- When access is write and open works
 *	MrmNOT_FOUND	- When access is read and the file isn't present
 *	MrmFAILURE	- When the open fails for any other reason
 *
 *  SIDE EFFECTS:
 *
 *      Opens or creates the named file and assigns a channel to it.
