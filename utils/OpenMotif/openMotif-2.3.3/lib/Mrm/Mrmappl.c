/*
 *++
 *
 *  PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:
 *
 *	MrmFetchWidget fetchs any indexed application widget. As usual in fetch
 *	operations, the fetched widget's subtree is also fetched. There are
 *	no constraints on this widget except that it must not also appear
 *	as the child of some widget within its own subtree, i.e. there must
 *	be no cycles in the subtree graph! MrmFetchWidget does not do a
 *	XtManageChild for the newly created widget.
 *
 *	The semantics of the URM database require that any widget which is to
 *	be fetched with MrmFetchWidget meet the following requirements:
 *
 *		o Not be referenced as the child of any widget in the database
 *
 *		o Be indexed
 *
 *	MrmFetchWidget replaces XmFetchTopmost, and is used to fetch
 *	topmost widgets where MrmFetchInterfaceModule is not used. A topmost
 *	widget is either the main window or any indexed widget whose parent is
 *	the top-level widget. MrmFetchWidget may be called at any time to fetch
 *	a widget which was not fetched at application startup. MrmFetchWidget
 *	determines if a widget has already been fetched by checking *w_return
 *	for a NULL value. Non-NULL values signify that the widget already
 *	has been fetched, and MrmFetchWidget no-ops. (If the toolkit ever
 *	supplies a validation routine for widgets, this will be used in
 *	place of a non-NULL check). Thus MrmFetchWidget may be used to
 *	defer fetching popup widgets until they are first referenced
 *	(presumably in a callback), and then fetching them once.
 *
 *	MrmFetchWidget may also be used to make multiple instances of a
 *	widget (and its subtree). In this case, the UID definition functions
 *	as a skeleton; there are no constraints on how many times a widget
 *	definition may be fetched. The only requirement is the *w_return be
 *	NULL on each call. This may be used to make multiple copies of
 *	a widget in e.g. a dialog box or menu (to construct a uniform form).
 *
 *	The index which identifies the widget must be known to the application
 *	via previous agreement.
 *	MrmFetchWidget will successfully fetch topmost widgets as long as the
 *	parent parameter is correct (the top-level widget), and this
 *	replaces XmFetchTopmost (which vanishes).
 *
 *  FORMAL PARAMETERS:
 *
 *	hierarchy_id	Hierarchy containing interface definition
 *	index		The index of the widget to fetch.
 *	parent		ID of the parent widget
 *	w_return	To return the widget id of the created widget.
 *			*w_return must be NULL or MrmFetchWidget no-ops.
 *	class_return	To return the code identifying the widget class.
 *			This is principally used to distinguish main window
 *			and other toolkit widgets. It will be one of the
 *			URMwc... codes defined in MRM.h. The code
 *			for a main window is URMwcMainWindow.

 *	ov_num_args	# args in ov_args; 0 for no override
 *	w_return	To return the widget id of the created widget.
 *			*w_return must be NULL or MrmFetchWidget no-ops.

 *
 *  PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:
 *
 *	This routine does an XtSetValues on a widget, evaluating the values
 *	as public literal resource references resolvable from a URM
 *	hierarchy. Each literal is fetched from the hierarchy, and
 *	its value is fixed up and converted as required. This value is
 *	then placed in the arglist, and used as the actual value for
 *	an XtSetValues call. This routine allows a widget to be modified
 *	after creation using UID file values exactly as is done for creation
 *	values in MrmFetchWidget.
 *
 *	As in FetchWidget, each argument whose value can be evaluated from
 *	the UID hierarchy is set in the widget. Values which are not found
 *	or for which conversion errors occur are not modified.
 *
 *	Each entry in the arglist identifies an argument to be modified in
 *	the widget. The .name part identifies the tag, as usual (XmN...).
 *	the .value part must be a String whose values is the index of the
 *	literal. Thus
 *		args[n].name = "label"		(XmNlabel)
 *		args[n].value = "OK_button_label"
 *	would modify the label resource of the widget to have the value
 *	of the literal accessed by index 'OK_button_label' in the
 *	hierarchy.
 *
 *  FORMAL PARAMETERS:
 *
 *	hierarchy_id	URM hierarchy to be searched for literal definitions
 *	w		the widget to be modified
 *	args		An arglist specifying the widget arguments to be
 *			modified. The .name part of each argument must be
 *			the usual XmN... string identifying the argument
 *			(argument tag). The .value part must be a String
 *			giveing the index of the literal. All literals must
 *			be public literals accessed by index.
 *	num_args	the number of entries in args.
